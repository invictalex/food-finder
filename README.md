# food-finder
 An app that finds recipes from the food in your fridge.

Currently at the basic layout stage. 

Bugs: when ingredients have been added, if they are completely removed the app bugs. You need to include a function that once
the user has inputted an ingredient, the minimum number of ingredients never falls below 0.

Also necessary is the ability to show more info on the cards, and link to the recipe.
